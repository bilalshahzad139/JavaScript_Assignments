## JavaScript Assignments  

There are a lot of interactive JavaScript resources for beginners, but most of them are online and do not cover the modern programming workflow.  So the motivation of this project is to prepare assignment to cover all standard JavaScript functions, to drilling and mastering skills. Some tasks are practical, but some tasks are rather synthetic.
### Organization of Tasks
